\section{Group Organisation}

As a first approach to the task, we decided to meet in the labs and to read through the specs
together in order to make sure every one of us understood correctly what was expected and to share 
our first ideas of implementation. Our first focus was centered on the first task of the project, 
being the implementation of an ARM emulator. We broke down the task into several modules and subproblems 
that could be easier to solve and that would generate an adequate level of abstraction for the implementation of 
the more general problem. These modules are described in the next section. We then distributed the workload 
between the members of the group and started to work 

The group is using \emph{Slack} in order to communicate during the whole project period. We agreed on meeting 
three times a week to coordinate the work and plan the future tasks, while still working on several bits of the 
code separately.

%HOW WELL WE WORKED - WHAT WE COULD CHANGE (more conventional use of git? ahaha)
