\section{Introduction}

We present an automated chess program to play against on a real world board. The
program first uses computer vision to detect the board and extract features to
get the state of the game. We then make use of the AlphaZero algorithm by
DeepMind to make a move. The AlphaZero algorithm runs on the SingularityNET
network which itself runs on the Ethereum blockchain. We thus propose a way for
anyone to defy AlphaZero.

\section{Computer Vision}

The first step for the program is to get the state of the board from a camera
and produce an internal representation of it. The goal is therefore to be able
to segment all the cells and determine whether they contain a piece or not.\\
To facilitate the image processing task, we make use of two green markers placed
at diagonally opposed corners of the board. With that we can get the board
itself, cropping out the rest of the image. From here, we subdivide the image
into 8 rows and 8 columns to get all the cells.

TODO: how do we determine if there's a piece or not

\section{AlphaZero and SingularityNET}

SingularityNET is a decentralised protocol based on the Ethereum blockchain that
allows to run AI algorithms on the network. Using their AGI token we can query
services of AIs running there and use their answer in our application.\\
We therefore make use of the AlphaZero algorithm developped by Google's DeepMind
in 2018. After processing the image of the board, we determine which move the
opponent did and send that information to the AI which in turn gives us back
what move it made.

TODO: talk about elo and all that

\section{Conclusion}
Talk about struggles how we overcame them like OGs etc
